# If true, will rely on the current IAM role for authorization
# instead of explicitly providing AWS credentials (access_key/secret_key)
# Default: true
#useIAM={USE_IAM}

# The HTTP endpoint to use for retrieving AWS credentials
# ECS tasks currently expose http://169.254.170.2 for this purpose
#
# This is ignored if useIAM is true
ecsCredentialsEndpoint=http://169.254.170.2

# The path component of the credentials endpoint URI.
# This value is appended to the credentials endpoint to
# form the URI from which credentials can be obtained.
#
# If omitted, the value will be read from the AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI
# environment variable (standard on ECS containers)
#
# You won't typically need to set this unless using AwsParamStore from outside
# an ECS container
